                On September 8, 2021, in the Blue Hall of the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador,
                Bitcoin officially became the national legal tender of El Salvador. This is the first
                country in the world to legislate Bitcoin as a legal tender, which means that the
                encryption world and the real world are gradually integrating. The beginning of
                cross-integration is a great change in El Salvador and one of the greatest
                changes in human history. On November 21 of the same year, El Salvador
                announced the construction of the world's first "Bitcoin City", which means that
                El Salvador is one of the first countries to implement digital transformation, and
                humans are also actively migrating from the physical world to the digital world.
                Bitcoin City will be a city of the future that combines reality and reality, and
                Bitcoin City’s digital identity will also be one of the most valuable and most
                promising digital identities in the world.
